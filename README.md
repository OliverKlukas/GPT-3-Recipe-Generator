## Challenge - Recipe Generator by B/S/H Hausgeräte GmbH
Create an OpenAI solution that creatively can generate recipes by incorporating a list of ingredients or a subset of these, by using cooking methods that are supported by Bosch Cookit and by including the user’s taste and preference.

## Instructions & Hints
Welcome to our Remy Cooking Assistant! To set up our application on your own devices, please follow the following guidance steps:
1. To start the project, please open the recipe_generator in your favourte IDE (we recommend Android Studio or IntelliJ)
2. The first file you are looking for is our lib/main.dart file!
3. Our app is optimized for IOS and Android, so we recommend emulating it on one of the two options
4. For the dynamic image retrieval for recipes and GPT-3 usage you need to add four environment variables when executing main.dart:
  1. OPENAI_FILE_ID = your personal file id of our recipe dataset uploaded to the OPENAI server
  2. OPENAI_KEY = your personal openai GPT-3 access key
  3. UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = your personal unsplash access key
  4. UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY = your personal unsplash secret key
5. Execute the main.dart file on your favourite emulator and enjoy our cooking companion Remy!
6. Bon Appetit!
